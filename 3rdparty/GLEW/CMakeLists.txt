# Filename: CMakeLists.txt
# Description: This will build the GLEW library which is used by GLEW. The
#   reason for rebuilding the GLEW external libraries is to make sure we can
#   always use the latest versions and to fix many static linking issues that
#   occur when compiling debug builds of the GQE library and linking them
#   against the GLEW release libraries.
# Modification Log:
# 2012-01-20 Initial version
#

# Define the GLEW project
project(${EXTERNAL_NAME})

# Define CMake arguments for copying build results to central directory
